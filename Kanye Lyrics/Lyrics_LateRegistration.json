The day his father passed away\nLeft him with a lil' something, sixteen, he was stuntin'\nAl B. Sure! nigga with the hair all wavy\nHit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy\nHit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty\nBoned so much that summer, even had him a baby\nSee back\u2014 back then\u2014 then, if you had a car\nYou was the Chi-Town version of Baby\nAnd I was just a virgin, a baby\nOne of the reasons I looked up to him crazy\nI used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked\nFelt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked\nWe'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall\nThey had them Lincolns and Au-rurr-ras, we was hurting 'em all\nWith the girls, a lot of flirting involved, but, dog\u2014\nFuck all that flirting\u2014now, I'm tryna get in some drawers\nSo put me on with these hoes, homie\nHe told me, \"Don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie\"\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nDrive slow, homie\n(Drive slow)\nYou never know, homie, about these hoes, homie\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie\n\n[Verse 2: Paul Wall]\nWhat it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving\nThe candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing\nThem elbows poking wide on that candy 'Lac\nTrunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth, relaxed\nI'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies\nAllow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes\nIt's a star-studded event when I valet park\nOpen up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark\nYou see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?\nThe disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'\nI'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab\nBut I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab\nA young Houston hard-hitter, all about the scrilla\nRidin' something candy-coated, crawling like a caterpillar\nI'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw\nI'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West & GLC]\nTurn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes\nDrive slow, homie\nIf you're riding around the city with nowhere to go\nDrive slow, homie\nLive today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know\nYou never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie\n[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]\nMy car's like the movie, my car's like the crib\nI got more TVs in here than where I live\nAnd that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit\nAnd everything I flip, you know it's something serious\nI got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims\nI got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence\nYou see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced\nThat you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit (Just a lil bit)\nI wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain\nMy canaries is gleaming through my angel wings\nThey see me, hoes actin like they seen a king\nWith that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green\nMy woodgrain oak, I'm riding on Vogues\nMy cylinder quiet, like tiptoes\nI sold O's, and this I know\nWhen you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow\n\n[Bridge: Tony Williams]\nOh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo\nMm, hm\nOh, oh, ooh, hoo, ooh\nMm, hm\nOh, oh, ooh, hoo, ooh\nMm, mm, mm, mm\n[Outro: Kanye West & Tony Williams]\nYeah\nB-boom, b-boom-boom\nOh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo\nMm, hm\nDrive slow, homie\nOh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo\nMm, hm\nDrive slow, homie\nOh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo\nMm, hm\nYou never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie\nMm, hm\nYou need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie\nDrive slow, homie47EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Kel', I bail and it\u2014\n\n[Outro: Gil Scott-Heron]\nMight not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again\nI'm on my way home\nI left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone\nHome is where the hatred is; home is filled with pain and it\nMight not be such a bad idea if I never\nNever went home again18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Remember when I was nine?\nTell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'\nHer family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'\nI'm arguin', like, \"What kind of doctor can we fly in?\"\nYou know the best medicine go to people that's paid\nIf Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS\nAnd all the broke motherfuckers passed away\nYou telling me if my grandma's in the NBA\nRight now, she'd be okay?\nBut since she was just a secretary\nWorking for the church for 35 years\nThings 'sposed to stop right here?\nMy grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he strong\nThat's where I get my confidence from\nI asked the nurse, \"Did you do the research?\"\nShe asked me, \"Can you sign some t-shirts?\"\n\"Bitch, is you smokin reefer?\nYou don't see that we hurt?\" But still\u2013\n[Hook: Bill Withers & Tony Williams]\nI smile\nWhen Rosie comes to see me\nAnd I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)\nCan't wait for the clouds to break\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nThey outside of the emergency room, room\nYou can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat\nIf she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon\nBut right now, she 'sleep, sleep, sleep\nMy momma say they say she could pass away any day\nHey chick, what these doctors know anyway?\nLet me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt\nCousin Kim took off of work\nPlus, my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Klaye and Aunt Jean\nSo many aunties we could have an Auntie Team\nFeel like Amerie, it's just \"1 Thing\"\nWhen they said that she made it, you see they eyes gleam\nI think we at a all-time high\nTo get there, we run, we fly, we drive\n'Cause with my family, we know where home is\nSo instead of sending flowers, we the roses\n\n[Hook: Bill Withers & Tony Williams]\nI smile\nWhen Rosie comes to see me\nAnd I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)\nCan't wait for the clouds to break\n[Break: Bill Withers & Patti LaBelle]\n'Cause Rosie brings the sunshine (Oh)\n\n[Hook: Bill Withers & Tony Williams]\nI smile\nWhen Rosie comes to see me\nAnd I can't wait for a sunny day (Seeing it through your eyes)\nCan't wait for the clouds to break\n\n[Hook: Bill Withers & Patti LaBelle]\nI smile\nWhen Rosie comes to see me\nAnd I'm sad when Rosie goes away\n'Cause Rosie brings the sunshine (Say)\n\n[Outro: Patti LaBelle]\nCan't wait, I can't wait, no\nCan't wait, I can't wait, no\nCan't wait, I, can't wait\nNo, can't wait, for\nFor a sunny day\nMomma can't wait\nFor the clouds to break\nMm mmm mm mm-mm mm-mm\nOh-oh-oh-oh, no, no, say\nTellin' you the truth now\nSaid I can't wait, uh-uh\nI won't wait, no58EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Now, nigga, that's a chaser\nTurn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior\nBest things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper\nHigh off the ground, from stair to skyscraper\nCool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major\n\n[Post Chorus: Kanye West]\nWe major? C'mon, homie, we major\nWe major? C'mon, homie, we major\nWe major! C'mon, homie, we major\nWe major! C'mon\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nFeeling better than some head on a Sunday afternoon\nBetter than a chick that say \"Yes\" too soon\nUntil you have a daughter; that's what I call karma\nAnd you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon\nProjects tore up, gang signs is thrown up\nNiggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up\nWhy else you think shorties write rhymes? Just to blow up?\nGet they first car and then, IRS show up\nHe ain't never had shit, but he had that nine\nNigga come through flicking and he had that shine\nPut two and two together and a little bad weather\nGon' be your whole family on that funeral line\nAsked the reverend, \"Was the strip clubs cool?\nIf my tips helped send a pretty girl through school?\"\nThat's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey\nI ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me\n[Chorus: Really Doe]\nYou motherfuckers better do your job and roll up\nAnd watch how we roll up, and\nI can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts\nI take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck\nI take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck\nBut really what's amazing is how I keep blazing\nTowel under the door, we smoke until the day's end\nPuff puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation\nHpnotiq for Henny?

C'mon, homie, we major\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nI heard the beat and I ain't know what to write\nFirst line\u2014should it be about the hoes or the ice?\nFour-fours or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice\nRap about big paper or the black man plight\nAt the studio console, asked my man to the right\n\"What this verse sound like? Should I freestyle or write?\nHe said, \"Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, still\"\nLooked at the pad and pencil, and jotted what I feel\nBeen like twelve years since a nigga first signed\nNow, I'm a free agent, and I'm thinking it's time\nTo build my very own Motown\n'Cause rappers be deprived of executive nine-to-fives\nAnd it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life\nAnd I love to give my blood, sweat and tears to the mic\nSo y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt\nI'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed\nI survived the livest niggas around\nLasted longer than more than half of you clowns\nLook, I used to cook before I had the game took\nEither way, my change came like Sam Cooke\n[Bridge: Tony Williams & Nas]\nBa-dop-ba-ba (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)\nFeeling better than I ever felt before today\nLike better late than never; it's orientation\nStill, we can make it better, throwing all your cares away\nOh, oh, oh, ooh!\n\n[Chorus: Really Doe & Tony Williams]\nYou motherfuckers better do your job and roll up\nAnd watch how we roll up, and (Ba-dop-ba-ba)\nI can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts\nI take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck\nI take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck\nBut really what's amazing is how I keep blazing\nTowel under the door, we smoke until the day's end\nPuff-puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation\nHpnotiq for Henny?

Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?\nEver, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nClose your eyes and imagine, feel the magic\nVegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses\nAnd I've realized that I've arrived\n'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe\n\"Does he write his own rhymes?\" Well, sort of, I think 'em\nThat mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of\n\"Damn, is he really that caught up?\"\nI ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?\nI remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort\nOr even a four-track recorder\nSo it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche\nSpoil yourself, that's important\nIf your stripper name \"Porsche\" and you get tips from many men\nThen your fat friend, her nickname is \"Minivan\"\nExcuse me, that's just the Henny, man\nI smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because\u2014\n[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever)\nThrow your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)\nThe Roc is still alive every time I rhyme\nForever ever?

Ever, ever?\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nI was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me\nOnly playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry\nAlicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him\nThirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him\nWhat more could you ask for? The international asshole\nWho complain about what he is owed?\nAnd throw a tantrum like he is three years old\nYou gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul\nAnd wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame\nWhen he came in the game, he made his own lane\nNow all I need is y'all to pronounce my name\nIt's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say \"Kayne\"\nGot family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown\nBack in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town\nLife movin' too fast, I need to slow down\nGirl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down\nMy father been said I need Jesus\nSo he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar\nThe preacher said we need leaders\nRight then, my body got still like a paraplegic\nYou know who you call; you got a message, then leave it\nThe Roc stand tall and you would never believe it\nTake your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic\nYeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic\nAfter debris settles and the dust get swept off\nBig K pick up where young Hov left off\nRight when magazines wrote Kanye West off\nI dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of\nA&R's lookin' like, \"Pssh, we messed up.\"\nGrammy night, damn right, we got dressed up\nBottle after bottle 'til we got messed up\nIn the studio with Really Doe, yeah, he next up\nPeople askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back\nThat'll be the same day I give the game back\nYou know the next question, dog: \"Yo, where Dame at?\"\nThis track the Indian dance to bring our reign back\n\"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?\"\nThey pray for the death of our dynasty like \"Amen\"\nR-r-r-r-right here stands a man\nWith the power to make a diamond with his bare hands\n[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever)\nThrow your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)\nThe Roc is still alive every time I rhyme\nForever ever?
