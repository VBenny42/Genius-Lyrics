What's a king to a god?\nWhat's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?\nWill he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild\n[Verse 1: Jay Z]\nTears on the mausoleum floor\nBlood stains the Colosseum doors\nLies on the lips of a priest\nThanksgiving disguised as a feast\nRolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche\nOnly the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police\nCocaine seats\nAll white like I got the whole thing bleached\nDrug dealer chic\nI'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach\nIs Pius pious 'cause God loves pious?\nSocrates asked, whose bias do y'all seek?\nAll for Plato, screech\nI'm out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks\nJesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats\nHova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats\nPreach\n[Chorus: Frank Ocean]\nHuman beings in a mob\nWhat's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?\nWhat's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?\nWill he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild\n\n[Bridge: The-Dream]\nI live by you, desire\nI stand by you, walk through the fire\nYour love is my scripture\nLet me in through your encryption\nYeah, yeah\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nCoke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra\nI call that jungle fever\nYou will not control the threesome\nJust roll the weed up until I get me some\nWe formed a new religion\nNo sins as long as there's permission\nAnd deception is the only felony\nSo never fuck nobody without telling me\nSunglasses and Advil\nLast night was mad real\nSun coming up, 5 a.m\nI wonder if they got cabs still\nThinking 'bout the girl in all leopard\nWho was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard\nTwo tattoos: one read \"No Apologies\"\nThe other said \"Love is Cursed by Monogamy\"\nIt's something that the pastor don't preach\nIt's something that a teacher can't teach\nWhen we die, the money we can't keep\nBut we'll probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap\nPreach\n[Chorus: Frank Ocean]\nHuman beings in a mob\nWhat's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?\nWhat's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?\nWill he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild\n[Outro: Frank Ocean]\nNo church in the wild\nNo church in the wild\nNo church in the wild228EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
